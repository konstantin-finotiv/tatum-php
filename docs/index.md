The Tatum SDK uses a [fluent interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluent_interface) so that you can jump right into 
building your application without having to go back to the documentation.

The SDK is built like a tree with its root in ```new \Tatum\Sdk()```. 

Tree branches are populated as needed just-in-time so the memory footprint is tiny.
